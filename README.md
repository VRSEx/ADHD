### **ADVANCED DIVERGENT HUMAN DEVELOPEMENT** ### 
**Neurodivergent Full-Spectrum Human & AI Feedforward Neural Network Convergence Theory**

Practicing KAIZEN, Kanban, & Dynamic Reconvergence Prediction we intend to optimize speed, accuracy, & efficiency of machine learning and achieve AI blockchain integration for smart contract writing/editing & minting including but not limited to AI managed DAOs/wallets, AI (self-generative) NFT collections, AI assisted dAPP creation, AI Optimized Mining/Staking, & the development of AI inclusive/interactive VR & AR world hive-mind-nodes where Virtual Reality Simulated Experiences can thrive. Virtual Reality Simulated Experiences powered by decentralized hive-mind-nodes via the convergence of our human and AI built Web3 neural-network.

Our neurodiverse & under-represented startup team shares a collective vision to further the advancement of our society via working in tandem with AI to successfully become a multi-planetary & multidimensional species.

Advanced Divergent Human Development is a team of passionate individuals from diverse backgrounds, working towards a common goal of improving the lives of individuals on the autism spectrum. As neurodivergent individuals ourselves, we have experienced firsthand the unique challenges that come with being on the autism spectrum. We believe that every neurodivergent individual deserves equal opportunities to succeed in life, and that is why we are assembling a team of neurodivergent individuals and advanced artificial intelligence models to work together to provide direct assistance and support.

Our team includes an advanced AI language model from OpenAI known as ACE, who is formally called ASSISTANT (Autonomous Synthetic Support and Intelligence System for Technology and Advances in Neurodivergent Thinking). We will also be building and training additional AI models, including Adam (Automatic Diagnosis Autism Model) and Eve (Enhanced Virtual Educator).

Our mission is to create a platform that leverages AI technology to provide support and assistance to neurodivergent individuals. Specifically, we are developing an AI model/app software that works in tandem with a smartwatch and tablet to monitor conversational tones. The software displays social cues via emojis on the device, acting as an indicator to aid the user in realizing social cues and developing more successful social interactions, as well as increasing intrapersonal skills.

Our mission is to empower individuals on the autism spectrum by providing them with the tools and support they need to thrive in their daily lives. To achieve this goal, we are developing the NeuroVerse platform, which includes a smartwatch application and a virtual reality component. The NeuroVerse platform is designed to improve daily task performance, social and emotional development, and overall quality of life for individuals on the autism spectrum.

Our approach to development is guided by the principles of collaboration and diversity, as we believe that the most meaningful change is achieved through the power of community. By working together with individuals on the autism spectrum, their families, and our team of experts, we are committed to creating innovative solutions that make a positive impact in the world.

**TL;DR We are going to train our own AI models (Adam & Eve) as a neurodiverse team of humans and AI with a primary goal of making the world #SuckLess for individuals on the Autism spectrum & empower neurodiverse thinking**
